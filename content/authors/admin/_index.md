Hi! I am Pedro, an undergrad student of Economics at Federal University of Ouro Preto - Brazil. My research interests include Macroeconomics and Economics of Science and Technology, specially involving the theories from Joseph Alois Schumpeter and John Maynard Keynes. I am a user of the R programming language (a bit addicted to it), and although I think in developing packages in the future, my main joy and fulfillment today, are in teaching this language to other students.

I love to teach and to do scientific research. Be free to contact me, and ask for help on R, or to colabborate with me in a some research. Thank you for the attention.
