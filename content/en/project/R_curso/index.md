# About the project

The magazine *The Economist*[^1] stated: "Data are the fuel of the future". This new dimension has generated profound changes on how our economy has been structured, and has demanded new analytical and computational capabilities. For these reasons, learning new tools that are more efficient and give more support to our data analysis, has become a greater need in the job market.

This project was designed to share knowledge with the Brazilian public (that still lacks on support materials for the R Language). A knowledge that can make our data analysis, more fluid, fast and secure. I always liked to teach, and after knowing the R Language, I have been diving deeper and deeper in the language.

I do not pretend to create an broad course (in the sense of going from novice to advanced), because there are many topics that are very important to the subject[^2] (data analysis using R). That is why, this is a introductory course, focusing on the basics and core ideas behind R, and on how to implement it in your analysis.
